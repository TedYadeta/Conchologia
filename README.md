A Reference Guide to BaSH and some other stuff.

I started this project to broaden my understanding of what you can do in the Terminal, starting with BaSH on Ubuntu 20.04, but can and will expand into other shells and OSes.

This code has no license, all I ask is that it is used responsibly. "Don't be evil" with it.
